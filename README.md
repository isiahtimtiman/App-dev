### Plot
In the spring of 2020, Ethan visits Joy, who is now working as a domestic helper in Calgary. 
Ethan proposes marriage to Joy, but finds himself stranded during the COVID-19 lockdown. 
Moving in with Joy, their relationship unravels as Ethan struggles doing menial jobs while his bar in Hong Kong goes bankrupt in his absence. 
A year later, Ethan's father becomes infected with COVID-19. Ethan immediately returns to Hong Kong but his father dies just before he arrives. 
Frustrated with his situation and with Joyâ€™s absence, Ethan has a one-night stand with a random woman, and is caught when Joy video-calls him to tell of her impending return.
Heartbroken, Joy calls off her engagement to Ethan.Three years later, Joy works at a nursing home and is applying to go to the United States in the hopes of becoming a registered nurse.
As she picks up a friend at the airport, she comes across Ethan and their mutual friend Jhim, who are now seeking to work in Canada. 
Working at a cafe, Jhim asks for additional job recommendations from Joy, who then asks him to provide his number, not knowing that Jhim had placed Ethan's number instead. 
Joy subsequently gets into awkward encounters with Ethan, leading her to suspect that he is chasing after her, but Ethan denies this.
At a picnic, Joy becomes jealous when a colleague at the nursing home, Baby, develops a crush on Ethan and proposes that they live together in the hopes that Ethan would become a permanent resident. 
Joy suddenly proposes that Ethan live with her instead as a common-law husband for a year, which Ethan accepts.

News of their renewed relationship sparks excitement among their friends and family back home and in Hong Kong, unaware that they are entering into a sham arrangement. 
However, Joy's feelings begin to change when Ethan volunteers to clean up at the nursing home and when Jhim tells her that Ethan had narrowly survived being stabbed by loan sharks over his bar and sold his house to pay off his debts. 
Joy and Ethan gradually reconcile, but a jealous Baby then invites Ethan for a chat in front of Joy.
When Ethan arrives later that night, Joy accuses him of cheating on her again, but Ethan says that Baby had threatened to report them both to the IRCC for fraud, leading Ethan to break off their relationship in order to save Joy's future. 
As Ethan apologizes for his past mistakes, Joy confesses her true feelings for Ethan, and they make love.
